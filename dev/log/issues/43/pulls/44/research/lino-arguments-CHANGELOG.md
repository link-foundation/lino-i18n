# lino-arguments

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- d34d6cc: Validate environment aliases only when read, so unrelated duplicate proxy or npm variables no longer prevent makeConfig from starting. Preserve ambiguity errors for requested keys and strict validation of configuration and .lenv sources.

  Refresh links-notation and ESLint to satisfy dependency freshness and packed-consumer checks, and make release preparation regressions independent of pending repository changesets.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6ad199b: Update all runtime, optional peer, and development dependencies to their latest
  releases, including yargs 18, links-notation 0.23, and dotenvx 2. Node.js now
  requires ^20.19.0, ^22.12.0, or >=23 to match yargs. Development and release
  tooling uses Node.js 24 and npm >=10.9.0. Add dependency freshness checks to CI.
  Preserve legacy flat argument parsing with links-notation's nested line/group
  nodes by traversing children in source order.
  Use an explicit test-file glob for compatibility with Node.js 24's test runner.

  Add isolated env/cwd configuration contexts, selective typed option-to-env
  mapping, an importable pure object resolver, and allowlisted bounded secret
  files with redacted failures. Preserve legacy process adapters and document
  source precedence and runtime/language boundaries. Fix JavaScript changeset
  and instant versioning plus GitHub release creation from js/ without Cargo.

  Add opt-in `makeConfig({ includePositionals: true })` support, returning a
  `positionals` copy of the final yargs `_` array with its types and order preserved.
  Keep the default options-only result and document process-style argv, named
  command positionals, passthrough, and reserved-key collisions.

  Refresh links-notation to 0.27.1, optional/dev dotenvx to 2.38.2, ESLint to
  10.13.0, eslint-plugin-prettier to 5.5.7, and Prettier to 3.9.10 to satisfy the
  dependency freshness check after their new releases.

  Assess links-notation 0.27.1 parser/CLI/environment interoperability and document
  the deliberate transitive dependency limit: published lino-env 0.2.8 still
  declares ^0.11.2, requiring an upstream release for full deduplication. Add
  cross-runtime regression coverage and a packed consumer CI check, including an
  isolated metadata-only upstream range migration that resolves one latest parser.

  Fix `changeset version` in the release job failing with `spawn deno ENOENT`:
  Changesets' auto-detected Deno formatter is disabled and the version bump is
  formatted with the project's Prettier instead.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ab4273c: Add Rust version and reorganize repository structure
  - Move JavaScript code to ./js folder
  - Add new Rust implementation in ./rust folder
  - Split CI/CD into separate js.yml and rust.yml workflows
  - Shared ./scripts folder between languages
